Skin Disease Detector – AI-Powered Web Platform
The Skin Disease Detector is a smart, form-based web application that uses machine learning (XGBoost) to predict skin diseases and offer personalised skincare recommendations. Developed with a privacy-first approach, it does not require any camera or image upload, making it easy and accessible for all users.

Users input their symptoms through a guided form, and the system analyses the data to predict possible skin conditions. It then generates a detailed skincare routine, including product names and usage instructions based on the diagnosis.
